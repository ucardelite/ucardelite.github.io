        <p>COVID-19 Update:</p>
        <p>
          Due to the unfortunate health concerns that COVID-19 has created worldwide, there has been
          a lot of unknown surrounding logistics and shipping. At this time, our suppliers remain
          unaffected and we will continue to update you as any changes occur. We ask for your
          patience as it can become difficult to predict how suppliers and their shipping times may
          be affected. We recommend sending your card to us through a reputable company with a
          tracking code for your peace of mind. We do not take responsibility if your plastic card
          goes missing in transit.
